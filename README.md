# Charts for The Economist

The following four charts were made as a first step in a recruitment process as a trainee data visualization designer for The Economist. The dataset were given directly by one of The Economist's journalists. 

These charts are entirely made in R (using ggplot2) and the code is available [here](https://github.com/daniloderosa/economistcharts/blob/main/Economist_charts.Rmd).
